Opening the Blackbox: Investigating the Neural Circuit of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Approach

 

The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence in the field of natural language processing has given rise to Large Language Models (LLMs) with unprecedented performance in various tasks. However, the complexity and opaqueness underlying these models, commonly referred to as the "blackbox" problem, pose significant challenges in understanding, explaining, and validating their decision-making processes.

 

A neural circuit, in the context of Large Language Models, refers to the interconnected network of artificial neurons or nodes within the model that work together to process and generate language-related outputs. We hypothesize that the neural circuit structure within LLMs is formed and adapted for specialized tasks. This implies that certain sub-networks or pathways within the model may be more active or critical for certain language tasks, while others might be specialized for different tasks like the human brain. By examining and understanding these structures, we expect to gain insights into how LLMs generalize and adapt to various language-related tass, which in turn will inform our efforts to optimize and refine these models for even greater performance, accuracy, and trustworthiness.

 

This grant proposal aims to develop an innovative research framework to investigate the neural circuitry of LLMs by leveraging cognitive neuroscience methods, particularly focusing on dimensional reduction and correlation techniques.

 

Our research objectives are two-fold. First, we aim to inspect the neural activity within LLMs by employing advanced cognitive neuroscience methods, including but not limited to multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA), representational similarity analysis (RSA), and connectomics. By utilizing these methods, we will map the high-dimensional neural representations in LLMs to a lower-dimensional space, enabling a more tractable and interpretable analysis of the underlying neural mechanisms. This approach will facilitate the identification of critical neural components and their interactions that contribute to LLMs' performance in language tasks.

 

Second, we seek to enhance the accuracy and trust worthiness of LLMs by understanding and optimizing their neural circuitry based on insights from our investigation. By uncovering the functional and structural organization of LLMs, we will be able to identify potential areas for improvement and propose targeted modifications to their architecture or training processes. This will not only result in more accurate and reliable models but also provide valuable insights for designing future LLMs with better interpretability and explainability.

 

The proposed research has the potential to make significant contributions to the fields of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and cognitive neuroscience. By opening the blackbox of LLMs and elucidating their neural circuitry, we will pave the way for more transparent, interpretable, and trustworthy AI systems that can be better integrated into various applications, ranging from healthcare and education to policy-making and social communication. Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of this research highlight the strength of MIT Media Lab, which foster collaborations between AI researchers and cognitive neuroscientists, promoting the development of new models, and applications at the intersection of these fields.

 

In summary, this grant proposal aims to advance our understanding of the neural circuit of Large Language Models through the application of cognitive neuroscience methods. The ultimate goal is to improve the accuracy, trustworthiness, and interpretability of LLMs, which will greatly benefit both the scientific community and society at large. The successful execution of this project will not only open new avenues for interdisciplinary research but also contribute to the development of more transparent and responsible AI systems, furthering our continued progress towards achieving human-level language understanding and processing capabilities.
